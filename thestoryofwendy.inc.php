				<h1>WENDY</h1>
				<h2>By Donna Liese</h2>
				<p>Once, there was a little gust of wind named Wendy. She was the size of a starling, and very strong spirited. 
				She was determined to blow faster than Mother Wind. 
				</p>
				<p>One day, Wendy blew her strongest, snapping twigs, and whirling 
				them through the air. She exclaimed, “See, I am greater than Mother Wind!” Blinded by envy, and not watching where 
				she was blowing, she plunged into some soft, green, moss. 
				<p>She bounced back up, frowned, brushed herself off, 
				and began blowing once again. “Nothing can keep me down for long,” boasted Wendy. 
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="wendyfullpage">
				<p>Dodging small forest trees, 
				she laughed and said, “By tomorrow, I shall beat Mother Wind in a race. 
				<br />”Grinning, she pushed herself a little harder, 
				closed her tiny eyes, and crashed face first into a tree!
				</p>
				<p>To this day, no matter how hard Wendy blows, she remains stuck on the bark of a tree.
				</p>
				<p>Will Wendy ever get unstuck from the tree?
				</p>
				<img src="images/turtle.jpg" alt="image of turtle" id="turtleimg">
				<p>One hot, humid day Wendy cried, “I’ll never be free from this tree!” She sputtered a small gust of wind, yawned,
				and fell fast asleep. Terrance the turtle plodded by, dragging a huge stick. Dripping with sweat, he collapsed and yelled, “Help!” 
				Wendy’s eyes snapped open, she asked, “What does help mean?”
				</p>
				<p>
				“Help means when you can’t do something yourself, someone assists you in doing it. My name is Terrance, and I need
				help getting this scrumptious stick to my grandma’s house, it’s her birthday gift.”
				</p>
				<p>Wendy chuckled, “I will help you.” “You’re a tree, you can’t help me.” “Actually,  my name is Wendy, and I‘m a 
				little gust of wind stuck to a tree. It’s quite simple, grab the stick in your mouth, roll onto your shell, and get 
				ready for a speedy ride.” Terrance cheered, “I’m all set!” Wendy blew a big gust, and Terrance went sailing down the
				path on his shell squealing, “Weeeeeeeeee…..Thank you Wendy!”
				</p>
				<p>Wendy waved goodbye and thought, “Maybe if I ask Mother Wind for help she would assist me.” She yelled, “Mother Wind Help!” 
				Trees swayed, leaves whirled about, and Mother Wind appeared with a smile as wide as the ocean.
				</p>
				<p>Wendy exclaimed, “Hi Mother Wind!”
				</p>
				<p>Mother Wind replied, “Hello Wendy.”
				</p>
				<p>“You know my name.” Mother Wind nodded. “Did you know I’ve been stuck here?”
				</p>
				<p>“Yes.”
				</p>
				<p>“Why didn’t you help me?”
				Mother Wind gazed at Wendy. “Because you were determined to do it for yourself and I didn’t want to interfere. You also needed to learn 
				to ask for help. Now I can help you. Are you ready to go?”
				</p>
				<p>“I sure am.”
				Suddenly, a dark funnel cloud appeared overhead, the wind roared, the ground shook, and Mother Wind cried, “Oh no! It’s my sister 
				Tessa Tornado. She’s angry with me and chasing me. I must leave now.”
				</p>
				<p>“Mother Wind, what about me?”
				</p>
				<p>“It’s too dangerous for you to come, you’ll be safer here. Trust me, I’ll be back.” Like a flash of lightening, Mother Wind vanished.
				</p>
				<p>A tear rolled down Wendy’s cheek. “Just when I thought I’d be free, I’m still stuck to this tree.”
				  Will Mother Wind return to free Wendy? 
				
				<!--h2>July</h2-->
				<p>Tessa Tornado spun through the forest sounding like an out of control freight train. Falling trees shook the ground, 
				   and branches ceaselessly whirled overhead. Wendy felt amazingly safe and whispered, “It’s like a giant bubble is 
				   protecting me from all harm, just like Mother Wind promised.”
				</p>
				<p>Moments later, the forest grew quiet again. Wendy’s eyes darted in every direction searching for Mother Wind.
				   Weeks passed with still no sign of her return. Wendy cried out, “I hope Mother Wind is alright. If she doesn’t 
				   return to help me I’ll be stuck on this tree for eternity.”
				</p>
				<p>At sunset, a flying wild eyed creature landed with a “BOOM!” It’s dripping wet, seaweed coated hair was tangled
				in a fish net. Wendy trembled and wanted to scream but was too terrified. In a low quivering voice the creature said, 
				“Hellllloooo Wennnndy.” Wendy sheepishly smirked, and squeaked out a faint, “Hi.” 
				</p>
				<p>The creature coughed up gallons of salt water, shook itself dry, and said, “That was a close call. I almost didn’t make it back.
					Tessa Tornado picked me up and threw me into the middle of the ocean.”
				</p>
				<p>Wendy yelled, “Mother Wind it’s you! Welcome back!” Mother Wind’s face glistened like a golden sunrise.
				   “Are you ready to go Wendy?” “Yes! Blow your hardest and set me free!” With great force Mother Wind blew but 
				   Wendy didn’t move. She blew over and over again but Wendy remained stuck.
				</p>
				 <p>“What’s wrong Mother Wind?”
					Mother Wind glanced skyward, and remained quiet for quite some time. She gazed at Wendy, her blue eyes sparkling like dewdrops in 
					the sunlight. Smiling she said, “Always remember, even when someone helps you, you can do a little to help yourself too. So, let’s 
					count to three. Then together, we’ll blow our mightiest gust ever.” One, two, three……………. Whooohhhhhh…………………”
					“Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!” cheered Wendy. “I’m free! I’m finally free! Thank you Mother Wind!”
				</p>
				<p>	“Hop on!” laughed Mother Wind. Wendy dove onto her back.
					“Where would you like to go? We have the whole world to explore!”
				</p>
				<p>“Well let me see,” said Wendy. “How about……………….”
				</p>
				<p>Where will Wendy and Mother Wind go on their first adventure? 
				</p>
				<!--h2>August</h2-->
				<p>Grinning and rubbing her hands together Wendy exclaimed, “Mother Wind, on our first adventure I would 
				like to go to HA HA HA CHOOOOO!” “Bless you, Wendy. Did you mean Hawaii?” “No. I meant HA HA HA CHOOOO!”
				</p>
				<p>“Are you catching a cold Wendy?” 
				</p>
				<p>“No.” Wendy scrunched up her face and tightly pinched the tip of her nose. 
				   In a nasally voice she replied, “Excuse me, Mother Wind, but the seaweed in your hair smells like rotten fish 
				   so the first place in the world I’d like to go to is a crystal clear lake where you can wash your hair.”
				</p>
				<p>“Sorry about the terrible odor. I know the perfect place to take a dip and smell sweet again. Hold on tight, 
				   here we go!” “Weeeeeeeeeeeee!” screeched Wendy tightly grasping the fish net on Mother Wind’s hair.
				   Mother Wind blew up, down, and all around.  Wendy’s laughter filled the air.
				  “Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeee! You are the greatest, Mother Wind! I feel like we are going one million miles per hour!”
				  Pine trees wildly whirled around as Mother Wind plummeted at an incredible rate of speed towards the sparkling water.
				</p>
				<p>“Are you ready for your swim, Wendy?”
				</p>
				<p>“Yes!”  A few feet from the water’s surface Wendy saw two eyes peering up at her. She screamed, “No, Mother Wind! Stop!”
				  Mother Wind grimaced, pulling herself back up as quickly as she could. “Vvoooooooshhhh!”
				</p>
				<p>“Whoooahhhhhhh, Mother Wind! Watch out for the trees!”
				 “BOOM!” She crashed on the ground.
				</p>
				<p>“Ouch!” cried Mother Wind, coughing up dirt. Stunned, she pulled herself up and brushed herself off.
				 “Phew! Now that was a close call!” exclaimed Wendy.
				</p>
				<p>“It sure was! Next time, please give me a little more notice before you want to stop.”
				</p>
				<p>“I’m sorry. I couldn’t help it. At the last minute, I saw my friend Terrance the turtle in the water and we almost crashed right into him.”
				</p>
				<p>“Oh, now I understand. I certainly wouldn’t want to hurt your friend. Do you want to go back for a visit?”
				</p>
				<p>“Yes, I’d love to see Terrance. Let’s surprise him by quietly swimming underwater and popping up right in front of him.”
				 Did Wendy really see Terrance the turtle in the water or was some other creature lurking beneath the surface? 
				
				<!--h2>September</h2-->
				<P>Silent as falling snow, Mother Wind and Wendy gently slipped into the lake. Moments later they saw
				   Terrance’s tiny legs paddling overhead. Mother Wind popped her head up in front of him and said, “Surprise!”
				   With bulging eyes, Terrance screamed, “Ahhhhhhhhh! It’s the seaweed serpent! Help!”
				</p>
				<p>Mother Wind slid back underwater. Wendy emerged smiling and said, “Terrance, calm down. It’s me, your friend Wendy.
				   Remember me?” 
				</p>
				<p>Terrance was panting and shaking. Squinting he whispered, “Hi Wendy. Phew, am I glad to see you. Watch out, the seaweed serpent is hiding 
				  directly behind you.”
				</p>
				<p>Wendy giggled, “That’s not a serpent. It’s Mother Wind with seaweed in her hair. Thanks to you teaching me how 
				   to ask for help, I called upon Mother Wind for assistance. Together we blew a mighty gust which freed me from 
				   the tree I was stuck on. We’ve been together ever since.”
				</p>
				<p>“Oh, Wendy, that’s wonderful! Where will you go next?”
				</p>
				<p>“First, Mother Wind needs to take a bath and wash that stinky seaweed out of her hair.”
				</p>
				<p>“Great idea!” cheered Terrance. “I’ll get her.” He dove down and motioned for Mother Wind to follow him. 
				  They poked their heads up at the same time.
				</p>
				<p>Wendy smiled, “Mother Wind this is my friend Terrance.”
				</p>
				<p>“Well hello Ter Ha Ha HA!…” Wendy wrapped herself around Terrance and disappeared underwater.
				  “CHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!” Mother Wind’s hurricane strength sneeze sent the fish net and seaweed flying through the air. 
				  The water looked like ocean waves thunderously crashing on the shoreline. Meanwhile, Wendy and Terrance were safely 
				  swimming along the bottom of the lake.
				  When it was quiet, they emerged and were greeted by a white light. Mother Wind’s long silvery hair glistened like a 
				  million moonbeams!
				</p>
				<p>“Mother Wind!” exclaimed Wendy, “You look stunning and smell as fresh as the rain. Where did the fish net and seaweed go?”
				</p>
				<p>Mother Wind pointed towards the tree tops. “Wow!” said Terrance. “Your sneeze must have launched them up there like a rocket!”
				 The three of them laughed.
				</p>
				<p>“Let’s have some fun,” said Mother Wind. “What would you both like to do?”
				</p>
				<p>“I know!” exclaimed Wendy. “Let’s take Terrance for a ride with us!” Terrance rapidly shook his head and said…
			   </P>
			   <P>Will Terrance venture forth on a ride with Wendy and Mother Wind?
			   </p>
				<p>“Let’s have some fun,” said Mother Wind. “What would you both like to do?”</p>
				<p>“I know!” exclaimed Wendy. “Let’s take Terrance for a ride with us! “Where would you like to go Terrance?”</p>
				<p>“Plitvice Lakes in Southeast Europe,” he blurted out. </p>
				<p>Mother Wind chimed in, “Oh yes, they are some of the most beautiful lakes in the world!”</p>
				<p>“Mother Wind?”</p>
				<p>“Yes Wendy.” </p>
				<p>“Can we all retire at Plitvice Lakes?”</p>
				<p>“I’m sure ready to rest and enjoy the emerald green water and endless waterfalls.”</p>
				<p>“Us too!” exclaimed Wendy and Terrance.</p>
				<p>Wendy took Mother Winds’ long silvery hair and wrapped Terrance and herself in it.</p>
				<p>“Hold on tight,” said Mother Wind, and “Whoosh!” they blew away.</p>
