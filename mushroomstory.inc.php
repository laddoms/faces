			<h1>THE STORY ~ Fred the Mushroom</h1>
			<h2>By Amber - Age 17</h2>
				<p>Fred was born as a little mushroom spore, deep in the fields of Mushtopia. He was the oldest of all his spore siblings. After a 
					few years, his siblings started to grow into a colony of mushrooms with perfect little umbrella heads. Fred stayed a simple 
					spore for over two decades. That’s 20 years! 
				</p>
				<p>One day Fred cried out, “Why am I the littlest of my siblings when I was born first?” His siblings replied, 
				   “You weren’t meant to be one of us! You’re too different! Why aren’t you growing like the rest of us?” With all of his siblings 
				   picking on him, Fred closed his eyes and bent his head and remained dormant for ten more years.

				<p>On the eleventh year, the sun started to shine brighter than it ever had. “Oh, this is lovely!” cried Fred’s siblings as they 
				   soaked up the vitamins from the sun. A couple of days past, and the heat wasn’t stopping. Fred’s siblings had no shade to hide 
				   themselves from the dangerous rays of the sun that was slowly burning them. “The heat is too much! I’m drying out and not feeling 
				   well!” complained Fred’s siblings. Fred, however, was not bothered by this heat, because he was protected by all his sibling’s 
				   perfect umbrella heads.
				</p>
				<p>“This is revenge for picking on me! The Fungi Forest God has come to show you that bullying is wrong!” yelled Fred as his 
				   siblings cried for water. “We’re so thirsty!” “My head is burning and drying up!” “Help us Fred!” As all of his siblings started 
				   to burn and cry out in pain, Fred didn’t want his revenge anymore, instead he wanted to do what was right; to help his siblings! 
				   (After all, he loved them.)
				</p>

		<div id="mushroomstory2">
				<p>Fred closed his eyes as tight as he could and concentrated on the moisture in the ground beneath him. He willed himself to grow 
				   big and tall to help protect his siblings from the dangerous sun. Suddenly, Fred popped a little fat mushroom body that was 
				   taller than any of his brother and sisters, to soak up a lot of water, a big nose to help him smell the rain and when it would 
				   come, and finally a big hat to shield all of his siblings behind him from the sun. “Thank you, Fred!” “We’re so lucky you’re our
				   brother!” “We love you Fred!”
				</p>
				<p>Fred had finally found his purpose as a Fungi, and he remained very happy as he protected his siblings every year from the summer 
				   sun. The End.
