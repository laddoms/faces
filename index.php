					<h2>About Faces in Nature</h2>
					<p>Explore Faces in Nature encourages children and families to head out to the great outdoors and let their imaginations take
					   them on a creative, fun-filled adventure. It is a discovery game in which everyone seeks to find extraordinary faces hidden
					   in Nature.</p>
				</div>
				<div id="welcome2">
					<h2>History</h2>
					<p>My first experience with a face in nature was right in my own backyard! I was feeling sad, as I gazed out the window, I looked up 
					   and saw a tree smiling at me. Can you see it in the photo below? Ever since that first tree smiled at me, Iâ€™ve discovered so 
					   many more faces in nature. I have seen faces in clouds, trees, rocks, and even bugs.  
					   Next time you head outdoors, grab your camera. I hope you too will have fun finding faces in nature.
					</p>

					 <p>My name is Eva Kealey, creator of Explore Faces in Nature. I have three children and two grandsons. One of the greatest 
						gifts in our lives has been playing outside, and soaking up what mother nature has to offer. I am an avid hiker who enjoys
